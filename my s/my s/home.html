		Do you have the passion to excel,
		urge to be creative, 
		a never-ending thirst for knowledge and the desire to grow?
		Then,
		MRV is the right place for you because we focus on building
		a culture of innovation 
		and breakthrough thinking, which results in value creation.
		The work environment and corporate culture ensure your personal 
		and professional development
		along with the overall growth of the organization.
		Ernest Dichter, architect, of Exxon's international campaign,
		writing in the Harvard Business Review in 1962,
		was fully aware that the means to
		overcoming cultural resistance depended on an "understanding" of the countries
		in which a corporation operated.
		He observed that companies with "foresight to capitalize 
		on international opportunities" must recognize that
		"cultural anthropology will be an important too
		the management and reconstitution of parochial attachments tol for competitive marketing".
		However, the projected outcome of this was not the assimilation of
		international firms into national cultures, but the creation of a "world customer".
		The idea of a global corporate village entailed one's nation.
		It involved not a denial of the naturalness of national attachments,
		but an internationalization of the way a nation defines itself</p></pre>
